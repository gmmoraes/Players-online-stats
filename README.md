# Players-online-stats


I used to play a mmorpg called Tibia when I was younger, I found that lately the game entered  on Steam Greenlight so I decided to create a program to check the online playerbase of the game.
This program gets the Online players information from the official game website and stores it in a database possibilitating the user to see a graph with all of the information stored in the database or a graph with the highest and lowest number of online players registered, showing the date of the record.
